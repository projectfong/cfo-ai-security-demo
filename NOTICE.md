## Project Name
`cfo-ai-security-demo`

## Description
This repository provides a **public-safe demonstration** of the AI Security Stack.  
It includes simulated integrations with `cfo-vessel` and `cfo-embed`, mock firewall ingestion,  
and deterministic evidence generation for educational review.  
All AI-related operations are offline echo representations.

## Ownership
All materials, documentation, and naming conventions contained herein are the property of Fong.  
This includes terminology, tiered memory identifiers (AISTM, AIMTM, etc.), and workflow descriptions.  
All rights are reserved.

## Use Restrictions
* Redistribution, commercial deployment, or derivative branding is prohibited.  
* This repository is for research and educational reference only.  
* Any reuse requires prior written permission from the copyright holder.

## Integrity and Evidence
Each API and CLI interaction generates deterministic, timestamped JSON evidence stored under `./evidence/`.  
These records provide reproducibility and audit transparency consistent with secure design principles.

## Framework Alignment
The repository aligns with established cybersecurity frameworks and best practices  
(e.g., NIST SP 800-171 concepts) to demonstrate audit-ready development approaches.  
It does not claim CMMC or other formal certification compliance.
