## Overview
`cfo-ai-security-demo` is a **public-safe demonstration** of the AI Security Stack.  
This repository operates fully offline and contains **no live data, credentials, or external network connections**.  
It is designed for controlled educational, research, and audit purposes only.

## Responsible Use
* The software must not be deployed in production or used to process real security data.  
* Only local, non-sensitive example logs should be used for demonstration.  
* All actions within the demo are deterministic and auditable; evidence files should be reviewed after each run.  
* No real inference or embedding operations are executed — all AI operations are mock simulations.

## Reporting Security Concerns
If a vulnerability or security concern is identified in this demonstration:
1. Do **not** publish or disclose it publicly.  
2. Report findings privately to the repository maintainer.  
3. Allow time for review and remediation before any external communication.

## Secure Design Practices
This demonstration aligns with established cybersecurity frameworks and best practices (e.g., NIST SP 800-171 concepts).  
It emphasizes:
* Offline and isolated operation  
* Deterministic behavior  
* Transparent evidence logging  
* Controlled audit reproduction  

No claims of CMMC compliance or readiness are made.

## Data Handling
* The demo does not transmit, collect, or retain real-world network or security data.  
* Evidence logs are created locally under `./evidence/`.  
* All evidence can be deleted manually at any time.
